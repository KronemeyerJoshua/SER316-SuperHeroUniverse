# SER316-SuperHeroUniverse

Abstract Factory - Spawn various types of villains, but all are classified as NPC's

Mediator - Villains and Hero Controllers interact with each other - Combat System

##Functional Methods Met

- On Earth, there exists many cities where villains live and "spawn".
- Every gang of villains will have their own lair in the city.
- Villains and Super Heroes battle each other when they run into each other (you can
  randomly make them meet how you see fit). The losers die and the winners take
  over the others strength. It is always a one on one battle.
 - Each super hero and villain has powers (you can be creative here, whatever you want
   to come up with). These powers are transferred when they battle and the winner
   gets the power of the one defeated.
 -  If the person defeated has a power the winner already has, just increase that power.
 - The simulation should end when either the villains or the heroes have won.
